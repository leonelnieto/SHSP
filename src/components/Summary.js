              In 2003, several Utah agencies came together to form the Utah
              Safety Leadership Executive Committee (USLEC). This united effort
              began years before there existed a federal requirement to form
              such a team. The group began meeting on a regular basis to address
              the growing number of traffic-related fatalities. The goal was to
              create a comprehensive, integrated plan aimed at reducing serious
              injuries and fatalities, with the ultimate goal of Zero Fatalities
              on Utah’s roads. To maximize heir efforts, additional safety
              advocates were asked to join the Team. This new, expanded group is
              called the Utah Safety Leadership Committee, which continues to
              row as our program develops. This united approach is working.
              Traffic fatalities in Utah have continued on a declining trend for
              the past decade.
            </p>
            <p>
              Utah’s ultimate goal is Zero Fatalities. The loss of even one life
              is too many. Think about it this way: When you ask someone how
              many of their loved ones they cant to lose on the road this year,
              everyone has the same answer: zero. In order to reach that goal,
              USLEC identified five behaviors that contribute to fatalities on
              Utah’s roads— drowsy driving, distracted driving, impaired
              driving, aggressive driving and not buckling up. The Zero
              Fatalities goal is the foundation of the Utah trategic Highway
              Safety Plan (SHSP). All of the focus areas of the SHSP are
              designed to help Utah reach its ultimate goal – Zero Fatalities.
              The SHSP is the culmination of the joint efforts of all traffic
              safety organizations in Utah and sets the direction for our future
              collective safety efforts. It cannot be focused on one
              organization or one specific area of concern. The Plan recognizes
              the importance each discipline plays in improving safety. Each
              organization has developed their own safety plan and
              implementation efforts in their specific area. As the various
              groups coordinate their safety plans, it leverages our limited
              resources, obtaining maximum impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Utah’s goal of Zero Fatalities supports larger goals nationwide
              and globally. The national strategy on highway safety, Toward Zero
              Deaths, sets the vision for traffic fatalities in the United
              States.
            </p>
            <h4 className="text-danger font-weight-bold">Five Es</h4>
            <p>
              The Utah Strategic Highway Safety Plan strategies are focused on engineering,
              education, emergency response and enforcement efforts. Each discipline has
              a unique direction to improve safety while being strongly connected to the
              others. However, while these are the main elements to improving traffic safety
              on our roads, there is one key element that is missing. It’s what we’ll call the
              fifth E: Everyone.
            </p>
            <h6 className="font-weight-bold">ENGINEERING</h6>
            <p>
              The focus on safety within engineering begins
              with designing, building and maintaining safer transportation systems.
              Transportation professionals use design principles
              that have been proven to be safe and reliable.
              National standards are used to provide consistency for the traveling
              public. Transportation professionals continue to look for
              new and innovative ways to improve roadway safety.
            </p>
            <h6 className="font-weight-bold">EDUCATION</h6>
            <p>
              Education plays a key role in helping the public
              understand what they should and should not
              do when driving. Increased education leads to
              a change in behavior and, ultimately, a change in our culture, leading to a decline in
              fatalities on our roads. Education efforts are
              directed toward all age groups and numerous
              safety issues.
            </p>
            <h6 className="font-weight-bold">ENFORCEMENT</h6>
            <p>
              Along with safety education
              programs and safer transportation systems, enforcement is needed to remind
              people of the laws associated with the use of our
              roadway network. State, county, and municipal
              law enforcement agencies statewide work
              alongside highway safety partnering agencies to
              enforce Utah’s traffic laws during regular patrols,
              as well as specialized mobilization efforts.
            </p>
            <h6 className="font-weight-bold">EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</h6>
            <p>
              Swift response from emergency teams can save lives. The emergency medical 
              services system includes trained dispatchers that ensure the right resources arrive 
              to provide care and address safety at the scene. Emergency medical personnel 
              affiliated with fire, ambulance services and public safety provide 
              seamless emergency health care and serve as the system's first responders. 
              They ensure the patients are triaged, treated and transported to hospital who 
              serve as the first receivers for definitive life saving care.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trained dispatchers ensure the right
              resources arrive to provide care and address
              safety at the scene. Emergency medical response
              teams provide life saving health care and ensure
              the patients are transported to the facility that
              best meets the needs of the patients. Public
              safety responders clear roadways, thereby
              reducing the risk of more crashes as
              a result of unexpected traffic conditions.
            </p>
            <h6 className="font-weight-bold">EVERYONE</h6>
            <p>
              The key to reaching zero fatalities is bigger than any one group. It’s bigger 
              than engineering, enforcement, education, and emergency response alone. Everyone 
              is needed in order to make a difference, and we all need to work 
              together if we are going to reach Zero Fatalities. Everyone is the 
              most important “E” in traffic safety.
            </p>
            <h6 className="font-weight-bold">EVALUATION</h6>
            <p>
              Evaluation is a critical element of
              an effective SHSP. But how do we determine
              success? Do we have Zero Fatalities on our
              roads today? Obviously not, but we are making
              progress. Progress in terms of raising awareness,
              changing behavior and saving lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ultimate measure of success is saving lives.
              In order to track the progress of the safety
              areas in the SHSP, most areas are represented
              by a committee, task force or group in which
              members are comprised of experts in their
              area and advocates for safety. Within the emphasis 
              areas, groups will be able to track their progress 
              toward meeting the goals that they have set and evaluate 
              opportunities for improvement based on the data or information that they see.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chairs from each
              of these groups meet with the Zero Fatalities
              Executive Committee (which includes members
              of the SHSP Executive Committee from UDOT,
              DPS, and UDOH) at least annually to discuss opportunities for collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2017, the UDOT Executive Director, Carlos Braceras, 
              challenged UDOT to reach 200 fatalities by the end of 2021, 
              which is a 6.8 percent reduction in fatalities per year 
              since 2017. The state of Utah has also taken on this goal. 
              The following graph shows how we will reduce fatalities 
              each year as we move towards our ultimate goal of Zero 
              Fatalities. Another goal that we are working toward is 
              reaching a fatality rate of .55% by 2024, leading the 
              nation in safety. At the end of 2018, the fatality rate was .79%.
            </p>
            <p>
              The impact of a serious injury crash can be life changing 
              for individuals in the crash and their families. According 
              to the National Safety Council, the average cost of a serious 
              injury in an automobile crash is: $208,500. On average, 
              there are 1,476 people seriously injured in crashes in Utah 
              every year, which means that Utahns are paying more than 
              $300 million in comprehensive costs for serious injuries. 
              This is why the state of Utah has set a goal of reducing 
              serious injury crashes by 6.8% per year, with the ultimate 
              goal of reaching zero serious injuries.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Utah Strategic Highway Safety Plan does not address every 
              safety strategy currently being implemented in the state, but 
              focuses primarily upon strategies with the greatest potential 
              to reduce crashes and injuries. These strategies are implemented 
              in locations identified using an evidence-based approach that 
              takes into account crash history, system characteristics, 
              environmental conditions and driver behaviors. The Plan acts 
              as the guiding document that influences the development of 
              specific goals, strategies and performance measures for the 
              individual organizations. It does not replace the existing 
              documents for each group, but it should reference and guide 
              development of other internal documents as necessary. The 
              process continues down through the organizations, resulting 
              in detailed programs and plans that are implemented and 
              finally evaluated to measure the success of reducing serious 
              injury and fatal crashes.
