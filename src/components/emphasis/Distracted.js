            <p>
              Fatalities related to distracted driving are a growing problem in the
              State. Distracted driving violations and crashes are under-reported
              due to deficiencies in crash reporting and the difficulty of attributing
              crashes to distractions. Unfortunately, drivers are increasingly
              engaged in other activities while driving, especially using interactive
              electronic devices

              driver distraction.
