                Education plays a key role in helping the public
                understand what they should and should not
                do when driving. Increased education leads to
                a change in behavior and, ultimately, a change in our culture, leading to a decline in
                fatalities on our roads. Education efforts are
                directed toward all age groups and numerous
                safety issues.
