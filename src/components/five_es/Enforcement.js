                Along with safety education
                programs and safer transportation systems, enforcement is needed to remind
                people of the laws associated with the use of our
                roadway network. State, county, and municipal
                law enforcement agencies statewide work
                alongside highway safety partnering agencies to
                enforce Utahâ€™s traffic laws during regular patrols,
                as well as specialized mobilization efforts.
