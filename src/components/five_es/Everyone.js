                The key to reaching zero fatalities is bigger than any one group. It’s bigger than engineering, enforcement, education, and emergency response alone. Everyone is needed in order to make a difference, and we all need to work together if we
                are going to reach Zero Fatalities. Everyone is the
                most important “E” in traffic safety.
